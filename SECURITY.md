# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

If you discover a security vulnerability in any DDS project, please report it responsibly:

1. **Email:** nicolas.gimenez@zkorum.com
2. **GitHub:** Use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) on the affected repository.

Please include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if you have one)

## Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment:** within 7 days
- **Assessment:** within 21 days
- **Fix or mitigation:** as soon as reasonably possible after assessment

## Disclosure

We practice coordinated disclosure. We'll work with you to understand and fix the issue before any public disclosure. We credit reporters unless they prefer to remain anonymous.

## Non-Security Issues

For bugs that aren't security-sensitive, please use the regular issue tracker. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
