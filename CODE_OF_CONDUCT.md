# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in DDS a welcoming experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We build tools for democratic deliberation. We practice what we preach.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior. See [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) for role definitions and authority.

Community leaders will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (GitHub repos, issues, pull requests, discussions, Discord, events, and any other space where you represent DDS). It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the DDS Code of Conduct committee at **nicolas.gimenez@zkorum.com**. Currently, the committee consists of:

- Nicolas ([@nicobao](https://github.com/nicobao))
- Stuart

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The committee is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining consequences:

### 1. Correction

**Impact:** Minor unprofessional or unwelcome behavior.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning with clarity around the nature of the violation and why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment, or aggression toward individuals or groups.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
