# Community Growth Strategy

Planning document for building the DDS contributor community. Goal: a small, high-quality contributor base before DWebCamp July 2026.

## Channels

- **GitHub** (primary) — Issues, PRs, Discussions. This is where the work happens.
- **Discord** (secondary) — Real-time chat for coordination. Low-volume, high-signal. Not a support forum.

## Growth Phases

### Phase 1: Seed (Now)

Get the house in order before inviting people in.

- Polish the GitHub presence (this repo)
- Write and publish the launch blog series
- Share in relevant communities (AT Protocol, civic tech, decentralized governance)
- Identify and personally reach out to 5-10 people who might care
- Make it dead simple to understand what DDS is and how to contribute

### Phase 2: Attract (Q2 2026)

Give people something to work with.

- Working proof of concept or reference implementation
- `good-first-issue` labels on tractable tasks
- Fast response to issues and PRs (< 48 hours for first response)
- Blog posts that show progress and invite participation
- Present at local meetups, online events

### Phase 3: Sustain (Q3 2026+)

Build structure as the community grows.

- Regular community calls (monthly or biweekly)
- Delegate maintainer roles to trusted contributors
- Document architectural decisions (ADRs) so newcomers can catch up
- Represent DDS at DWebCamp July 2026
- Evaluate whether governance model needs to evolve

## Target Communities

- **AT Protocol developers** — building on the same foundation, natural allies
- **Civic tech** — [Polis](https://pol.is/), [Decidim](https://decidim.org/), [Loomio](https://www.loomio.com/) communities — people who already care about deliberation
- **DAO tooling** — Snapshot, Tally, Aragon ecosystems — on-chain governance practitioners
- **Decentralized governance researchers** — academics, think tanks, governance nerds

## Anti-Patterns

Things to actively avoid:

- **Don't over-govern before there's anything to govern.** Process should follow people, not precede them.
- **Don't treat the pre-1.0 spec as sacred.** Everything is up for discussion. The spec will change. That's the point.
- **Don't optimize for contributor count.** 5 engaged contributors > 50 drive-by stars. Quality over quantity.
- **Don't create channels nobody uses.** Start with GitHub. Add Discord when there's demand. Don't create a forum, a Matrix room, a Slack, and a mailing list on day one.
- **Don't ghost people.** Fast response to contributions is the single best community-building tool. If someone opens a PR, respond. If someone asks a question, answer.

## Success Metrics

Not vanity metrics. Real ones:

- Number of people who've submitted a PR or filed a substantive issue
- Median response time to new issues/PRs
- Number of contributors who return for a second contribution
- Quality of discussion in GitHub Discussions
- Presence at DWebCamp with something real to show
