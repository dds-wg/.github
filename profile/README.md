# Decentralized Deliberation Standard

**Public deliberation depends on platforms that can disappear, censor, or shape outcomes.** Algorithms influence consensus, services shut down, and collective decisions vanish with them. Communities deserve infrastructure they control.

**DDS is a vendor-neutral protocol for secure, censorship-resistant public deliberation.** It separates the *process* of deliberation from the platforms that host it, so communities own their discussions, their data, and their outcomes. Built on [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/) for identity and social infrastructure, with [Arweave](https://arweave.org/)/[Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/)/[Logos](https://logos.co/) for permanent archival and [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) for on-chain verification.

## How It Works

Every deliberation follows a lifecycle:

- **Plan:** Define the question, the rules, and the participants.
- **Collect:** Gather responses through structured or open-ended formats.
- **Analyze:** Surface consensus, clusters, and outliers, transparently and reproducibly.

No single platform controls the process. Any conforming tool can participate.

## Use Cases

- **Governance:** DAOs, cooperatives, municipalities making collective decisions
- **Participatory budgeting:** Communities allocating shared resources
- **Collective intelligence:** Structured sense-making at scale
- **Policy consultation:** Governments gathering informed public input
