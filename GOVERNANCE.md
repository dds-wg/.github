# Governance

## The Project

The DDS Project is an open source protocol for secure, censorship-resistant public deliberation. Software is released under BSD-2-Clause-Patent; specifications and documentation under CC-BY-4.0. Everything happens in public at [github.com/dds-wg](https://github.com/dds-wg).

The project is designed to be interoperable and modular. We actively try to accommodate the diverse use-cases of individuals and teams — that flexibility is what makes it flourish. When conflicts arise between competing needs, however, decisions must be made that preserve consistency and the project's core objectives.

## Roles

### Contributor

Anyone who opens an issue or submits a pull request. No approval needed. Influence comes from the work, not from titles.

### Maintainer

A Contributor who has earned commit rights by demonstrating sustained, quality contributions and a willingness to help others — not just advance their own interests. Maintainers review and merge pull requests. The BDFL appoints Maintainers; a Maintainer inactive for a year may be removed after being given a chance to return.

### BDFL

Responsible for the overall vision and project goals. Has final authority on all decisions. In practice defers to Maintainers and community consensus, and only steps in to break deadlocks or when asked. Can appoint their own successor; if unable, Maintainers decide.

Currently: **Nicolas** ([@nicobao](https://github.com/nicobao))

## Decision Making

Consensus comes first. We prefer rough agreement reached through open discussion over top-down decisions. Decisions happen in public on GitHub issues and pull requests. Default is lazy consensus: if nobody objects, it passes. Maintainers can merge PRs they judge to be correct. The BDFL steps in only when consensus fails or when a decision would conflict with the project's core objectives.

## Changing This Document

Submit a pull request. Maintainers review; the BDFL has final say.
