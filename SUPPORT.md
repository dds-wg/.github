# Getting Help

## Where to Ask Questions

### Open Calls

TBD

### Discord / Matrix

[TBD, invite link]

Real-time chat for quick questions and coordination. We keep it low-volume and high-signal.

### GitHub Issues

At this stage, issues are open for any kind of discussion: bugs, features, ideas, questions. Use them freely.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to file good issues and submit PRs.
